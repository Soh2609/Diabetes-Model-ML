# Diabetes-Model-ML
I have tried to train Machine Learning model using diabetes dataset available on kaggle to predict whether the person is diabetic or not.
# Diabetes Classification Project

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on patient data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation and testing

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Usage
1. Open the `Diabetes.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available for educational purposes.
